My current research interests are focused on the analysis of high dimensional omic data and development of new methods. In particual Im interested in data produced by single-cell RNAseq technology (scRNASeq). ScRNASeq has emerged as a powerful technology in particular for studying intracellular heterogeneity. Thanks to this revolutionary technique known or novel cell types can be identified and characterised. However, many challenges specific to scRNASeq data makes the identification of cell populations non trivial. For this reason development of more efficient and robust methodology is crucial. Therefore, my current work focuses on inferring performance and quality of various clustering methods designed for cell type identification as well as developing my own cell-clustering algorithm.
